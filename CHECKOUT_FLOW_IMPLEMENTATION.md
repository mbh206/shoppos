# Checkout Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a professional POS checkout flow with improved UX that keeps seats occupied until payment is complete, supports bill merging, split payments, and Square Terminal integration.

## Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added payment group fields to Order model:
  - `paymentGroupId` - Groups orders paid together
  - `isPrimaryPayer` - Identifies which order processes payment
  - `paidByOrderId` - References which order paid for this one

### 2. Timer Stop Behavior Changes
- Modified `/api/seats/[id]/timer/route.ts` to keep seats occupied after stopping timer
- Added metadata to track timer stopped state
- Order status changes to `awaiting_payment` when timer stops
- Seats only clear after successful payment

### 3. Table View UI Updates
- Yellow highlighting for stopped timers (ready to pay)
- "Ready to pay" status badge
- Prominent Checkout button when timer is stopped
- Visual distinction between occupied and ready-to-pay states

### 4. Bill Merging API
- Created `/api/orders/merge/route.ts` endpoint
- POST: Merge multiple orders into payment group
- DELETE: Unmerge orders from payment group
- Tracks primary payer and linked orders

### 5. Enhanced Checkout Page
- Displays merged orders when paying for group
- Shows combined totals for all linked orders
- Split payment modal with points, cash, and card options
- Visual indicators for payment processing
- Square Terminal integration for card payments

### 6. Square Terminal Integration
- Created Square Terminal service (`/lib/square-terminal.ts`)
- API endpoint for Square Terminal operations (`/api/square/terminal/route.ts`)
- Mock implementation ready for real Square SDK integration
- Processing modal shows during terminal payment
- Automatic polling for payment status

### 7. Receipt Page
- Already existed with full functionality
- Shows points earned and redeemed
- Customer loyalty balance display
- Print-friendly layout

### 8. Payment Processing
- Supports multiple payment methods in single transaction
- Points redemption with balance checking
- Automatic points earning on eligible purchases
- Seat cleanup after successful payment
- Table status updates when all seats cleared

## User Flow

### Single Seat Checkout
1. Staff stops timer → Seat stays occupied, shows "ready to pay"
2. Navigate to checkout page
3. Select payment method (cash/card/split)
4. Process payment → Seat clears automatically
5. Redirect to receipt page

### Group Payment (Bill Merging)
1. Stop timers for multiple seats
2. Call merge API to group orders
3. Primary payer's checkout shows all merged orders
4. Process combined payment
5. All linked seats clear simultaneously
6. Single receipt for entire group

### Split Payment
1. Select "Split Payment" option
2. Enter amounts for each payment method:
   - Points (if customer has balance)
   - Cash
   - Card
3. System validates total equals bill amount
4. Processes each payment method
5. Receipt shows all payment methods used

## Square Terminal Flow
1. Select card payment
2. System checks Square Terminal availability
3. Creates checkout on terminal
4. Shows processing modal
5. Polls for payment completion
6. Records payment and clears seats
7. Redirects to receipt

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified/Created
- `/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema updates
- `/src/app/api/seats/[id]/timer/route.ts` - Timer stop logic
- `/src/app/(authenticated)/floor/table/[id]/page.tsx` - Table view UI
- `/src/app/api/orders/merge/route.ts` - Bill merging API
- `/src/app/(authenticated)/checkout/[id]/page.tsx` - Enhanced checkout
- `/src/lib/square-terminal.ts` - Square Terminal service
- `/src/app/api/square/terminal/route.ts` - Square Terminal API
- `/src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - Added paymentGroupId filter

### Environment Variables Needed for Square
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_app_id
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_location_id
SQUARE_DEVICE_ID=your_device_id (optional)
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Single Seat Flow**
   - Start timer → Stop timer → Verify seat stays occupied
   - Complete checkout → Verify seat clears
   - Check receipt for correct totals and points

2. **Group Payment**
   - Start multiple timers at same/different tables
   - Stop all timers
   - Merge bills via API
   - Verify combined checkout shows all orders
   - Complete payment → Verify all seats clear

3. **Split Payment**
   - Create order with customer (for points)
   - Use split payment with multiple methods
   - Verify each payment method processes correctly
   - Check points deduction and earning

4. **Square Terminal**
   - Configure Square credentials
   - Test card payment flow
   - Verify terminal communication
   - Check payment recording

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Square SDK Integration**
   - Replace mock implementation with actual Square SDK
   - Add terminal device selection
   - Implement receipt printing via Square

2. **Advanced Bill Splitting**
   - Item-level bill splitting
   - Custom split amounts per seat
   - Split by percentage

3. **Payment Reports**
   - Daily payment method breakdown
   - Merged bill analytics
   - Terminal transaction logs

4. **Customer Features**
   - Email receipts
   - SMS notifications
   - Digital receipt storage

## Migration Notes

The implementation uses `prisma db push` for schema updates. For production:
1. Create proper migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-payment-groups`
2. Test migration on staging environment
3. Deploy with proper backup procedures

## Security Considerations

- Square credentials stored in environment variables
- Payment attempts tracked with audit trail
- User authentication required for all payment operations
- Sensitive payment data not stored locally
- Points transactions logged for accountability
